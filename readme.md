**Download into your Wordpress theme folder**
**Install plugin https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-api-menus/ `WP rest API Menus`. This will add menus to the wp-json**
**Theme does not contain front files, since it is intended to be used as a headless theme. However, do not delete styles.css file, nor index.php file.**
**Replace screenshot image**
**Good luck**
