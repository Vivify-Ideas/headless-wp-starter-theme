1. **Download into your Wordpress theme folder**

2. **Install plugin https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-api-menus/ `WP rest API Menus`. This will add menus to the wp-json**

3. **Theme does not contain front files, since it is intended to be used as a headless theme. However, do not delete styles.css file, nor index.php file.**

4. **Replace screenshot image**

5. **Good luck**
